FDR2 -BD is a methodological data condensation approach for reducing tabular big datasets in classification problems. The key of our proposal is to analyze data in a dual way (vertical and horizontal), so as to provide a smart combination between feature selection to generate dense clusters of data and uniform sampling reduction to keep only a few representative samples from each problem area. Its main advantage is allowing the model’s predictive quality to be kept in a range determined by a user’s threshold. Its robustness is built on a hyper-parametrization process, in which all data are taken into consideration by following a k-fold procedure. Another significant capability is being fast and scalable by using fully optimized parallel operations provided by Apache Spark.
